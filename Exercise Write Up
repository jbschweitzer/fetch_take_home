1. data exploration

    - are there any data quality issues present?

        ** transactions table **
            - there appeared to be many duplicate records with the use of a composite key comprised of receipt_id, user_id, and barcode. I opted to remove these duplicate records in the source csv prior to loading the data to my datawarehouse.
              the code i used to identify this was:
                  
                  
        ** users table **

        ** products table **
