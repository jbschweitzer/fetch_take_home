1. Data Exploration

    - Are there any data quality issues present?

        ** Transactions **
            - there appeared to be many duplicate records with the use of a composite key comprised of receipt_id, user_id, and barcode. I opted to remove the duplicate records, that had either no units or no sales associated, in the source csv prior to loading the data to my datawarehouse.
              the code i used to identify these duplicates was:

                  
        ** Users **

        ** Products **

    - Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?
        - I was initially caught off guard by the final_quantity field having values with decimals
