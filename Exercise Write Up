1. Data Exploration

    - Are there any data quality issues present?
    - Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?

        ** Users **
            - There are no duplicate or null records in the id column which fares well for using this as the primary key to join to the transactions table. To test not null and unique I ran these queries
                - Unique:
                    select
                          id,
                          count(*) as record_count
                    from `fetch.users`
                    group by
                          id 
                    having 
                          record_count > 1
                - Not Null
                    select
                          *
                    from `fetch.users`
                    where
                          id is null
            - 3.7% (3,675 of 100,000 records) of the birth_date fields are null. A measureable percentage but my assumption is that is is not so many that we are unable to draw directionally correct business insights regarding user ages. 
                I would caveat any age based analysis with this information alongside my working assumption that null birth dates are proportionately empty. The code used to idenitfy this was:
                    select
                          *
                    from `fetch.users`
                    where
                          birth_date is null
            - The state field is null 4.8% (4,812 records) of the time in the users table. Similar assumptions and code used as above
            - A more significant percentage (30.5%) of the language field are null in this table to where I would not make aggregate reporting or decisions without further investigation on how this information is captured.
                On this same note, the two values that are present, are 'en' and 'es-419' which require assumptions about their significance that would be worth exploring with stakeholders and documenting
            - 5.9% (5,892) of the gender column fields are null. This field is also populated with some values that appear to represent the same information (ie 'prefer_not_to_say' and 'Prefere not to say') which I believe is worth exploring within whomever
                captures this information to see if data validation and normalization could be introduced upstream of the data coming into the data warehouse. To identify this, I used this code:
                    select distinct
                          gender,
                          count(*) as record_count
                    from `fetch.users`
                    group by
                          gender 
                    order by
                          record_count desc

        ** Transactions **
            - there appeared to be many duplicate records with the use of a composite key comprised of receipt_id, user_id, and barcode. I opted to remove the duplicate records, that had either no units or no sales associated, in the source csv prior to loading the data to my datawarehouse.
              the code i used to identify these duplicates was:

                  
       

        ** Products **

    - Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?
        - I was initially caught off guard by the final_quantity field having values with decimals
